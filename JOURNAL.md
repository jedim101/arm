# May 18 - May 28: Began CAD (Base & First stage)

### Base

The base consists of a bottom piece, which holds the Arduino Uno and the Stepper Motor to control the bottom rotation. There are two covers, one to cover the motor and hold it in place, and one to cover the Arduino. The covers are screwed on using M3 Screws and heatset inserts in the bottom. The motor cover includes a hole for wires, and the other side includes holes for plugs (second image). The motor cover also includes a ring-shaped cutout sized for a 17x30x9 Thrust Bearing.

### Stage 1

Mounted to the Stepper motor is the 3-piece housing for the first stage, which includes an MG996R Servo and an AS5600 Magnetic Encoder. The first stage is mounted onto the stepper motor in the base with a shaft collar.

The housing also contains areas for the wires
